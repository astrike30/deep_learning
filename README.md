# Neural-Net Implementation with Numpy
- Pure, simple deep neural-network implementation with Numpy. Supports multiple layers of any length and any number of outputs.
- Can achieve a score of around 0.9 on [MNIST](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/) dataset.
- Currently uses sigmoid for activation.

## TODO
- Multiple activation functions (maybe even custom if derivative is supplied).
- More implementations.
- Different types of networks: convolutional, recurrent etc..
